             <h3> Essential Facts </h3>
             <ul>
               <li>Charles Darwin was born in Shrewbury, Great Britain in February 1809.</li>
               
               <li> In 1831, he set off on a South American voyage with the HMS Beagle where he collected and preserved many plant and animal specimans.</li>
               <li> During and after his travels he noticed the many similarities and differences of species across the globe thus providing the curiousity to find the reason behind such variation or lack therof.</li>
               <li><em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</em>was published in 1859. Darwin was pushed to publish after learning another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was planning to publish his own evolution theory.</li>
              <li>Darwin left the defense of his theory to his friend Thomas Huxley. In 1860 Bishop Wilburforce challenged Darwin's theory while Huxley and scientist Joseph Hooker defended it. In the usual result of these kinds of debates, both sides felt they won the argument.</li>
              <li>Darwin's ideas created controversy well after his death. In 1925, John Scopes, a biology teacher, was tried by the state of Tennessee, USA, for committing the misdemeamor of teaching evolution in public school.</li>
              <li>Darwin died in April 1882 and was interred at Westminster Abbey as a respected naturalist and scientist. (He's not far from Sir Isacc Newton in the Abbey.) </li>
               <li>Darwin appears on the UK 10 pound note. According to <a href=www.history.com>history.com</a> he will be replaced by Jane Austen sometime in 2017.</li>

              <h3>Personal Facts</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Both of his grandfathers were scholars, his maternal grandfather is Josiah Wedgewood who developed pottery that became very popular and invented the pyrometer, which measures oven temperatures. His paternal grandfather, Erasumus Darwin was a highly regarded doctor, scientist and poet.</li>
               <li>Darwin studied Divinity at Christ's College and Medicine at Edinburgh University but was not considered a good student in either subject. It is said Darwin hated lecture and liked to roam about the countryside instead.</li>
                <li>He learned taxidermy from a freedman while studying in Scotland.</li>
                <li>He was an abolisionist.</li>
                <li>He married his first cousin Emma Wedgewood in 1839. Darwin actually drew up a list on the pros and cons of marriage. The pros included "better than a dog anyhow" and cons included "less money for books". </li>
                <li>Darwin suffered from bouts of ill health throughout life, some theorize it was due to anxiety. Some believe he may have contracted a parasite called Chagas disease that affects the cardiac system.</li>
